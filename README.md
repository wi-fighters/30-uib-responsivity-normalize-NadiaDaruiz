* What do you notice now that `normalize.css` is being used? Add your answer to this `README` file.

A: Almost zero style is applied. Pics are in different sizes, no borders or layouts. Pretty much everything is display as presented in the html.

* Why is `normalize.css` useful? 

A: I think is interesting if you wanna style your web from scratch. As well as for consistency (between browsers).

* What is the difference between normalize and css resets? 

A: For reset: "The basic reason is that all browsers have presentation defaults, but no browsers have the same defaults." Basically, you reset so you can apply your own style. 
In the case of normalize: "provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. Itâ€™s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset." So you keep those  useful default styles.
